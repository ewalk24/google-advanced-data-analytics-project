# google-advanced-data-analytics-project
This is coding for a project in Coursera's Google Advanced data analytics certificate. 
The fictional project involves a step by step process of creating a machine learning model for tik tok. Tik tok wants a classification model built to determine whether authors videos contain claims or opinions. 
I will paste the python code I use in this repository from the eda phase up to the creation and testing of the machine learning model.
